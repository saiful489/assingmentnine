      <h2>what is context Api </h2>
      <p>
        Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without
        having to pass props down manually at every level.

      <h2>what are the semantic tags in html?</h2>
      <p>
        Semantic HTML or Semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the
        web page rather than just presentation. For example, a tag indicates
        that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and
        presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers are also
        know how to display them.
